\title{Summarise a snpmod object}
\usage{
guess.summ(results, groups = NULL, snps = NULL, snp.data = NULL,
  position = "position", tag.thr = 0.8, pp.thr = 0.01,
  method = "complete")
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{an object of class snpmod, or a named list of such objects}

\item{groups}{object of class groups.  If supplied, all SNPs here will be summarised, and grouped according to this structure}

\item{snps}{data.frame giving details of the SNPs}

\item{snp.data}{if groups is missing, tag groups are determined from this object of class SnpMatrix}

\item{position}{name of column in snps data.frame giving SNP position. default="position"}

\item{tag.thr}{if groups is missing, threshold at which to tag}

\item{pp.thr}{if groups is missing, threshold above which SNPs are selected for summary.}

\item{method}{if groups is missing, method to determine tag groups using heirarchical clustering, default is "complete"}
