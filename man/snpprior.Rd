\usage{
snpprior(
  x = 0:10,
  n,
  expected,
  overdispersion = 1,
  pi0 = NA,
  truncate = NA,
  overdispersion.warning = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{number of SNPs in a model (defaults to 1:length(groups), ie returns a vector)}

\item{n}{total number of SNPs or SNP groups available}

\item{expected}{expected number of SNPs in a model}

\item{overdispersion}{overdispersion parameter.  Setting this to 1
gives a binomial prior.  Values < 1 are nonsensical: if you really
believe the prior should be underdispersed relative to a binomial
distribution, consider using a hypergeometric prior.}

\item{pi0}{prior probability that no SNP is associated}

\item{truncate}{optional, if supplied priors will be adjusted so models with x>truncate have prior 0}

\item{overdispersion.warning}{by default, prior distributions should be binomial or beta-binomial (overdispersed).  If you give an overdispersion <1, snpprior will stop with an error.  Set overdispersion.warning=FALSE to override this.}

\description{
(Beta) Binomial prior for number of SNPs in a model
}
\details{
A binomial prior for the number of SNPs in a model may be
considered too peaked if there is relatively little prior
information about the number of causal SNPs, and, particularly if
the posterior model choice is sensitive to this prior, it can be
useful to consider a prior with greater spread.  One such choice
is the beta binomial model, implemented here, under which the
number of SNPs follows a binomial distribution with parameters n,
p while p follows a beta distribution with parameters chosen so
that the mean and the overdispersion (relative to a binomial
distribution) of the number of SNPs is as specified by
\code{expected} and \code{overdispersion}, respectively.  An
overdispersion of 1 corresponds to a binomial prior.
}
\examples{
n<-100 # 100 SNPs in region
x <- 1:10 # consider prior for up to 10 causal SNPs
xbar <- 3 # expect around 3 causal

## a binomial prior
y <- snpprior(x, n, xbar)
plot(x, y, type="h")

## is equivalent to
y1.0 <- snpprior(x, n, xbar, overdispersion=1.0)
points(x, y1.0, col="red")

##larger values of overdispersion change the distribution:
y1.1 <- snpprior(x, n, xbar, overdispersion=1.1)
y1.5 <- snpprior(x, n, xbar, overdispersion=1.5)
y2.0 <- snpprior(x, n, xbar, overdispersion=2.0)
points(x, y1.1, col="orange")
points(x, y1.5, col="pink")
points(x, y2.0, col="green")
